        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>My name is <strong>Liam Callaghan.</strong> I was born and raised in Southern Richmond,
        and I have come to BCIT so I can become a <em>white hat hacker</em> in remote locations.</p>

        <p>My name isn't <strong>Liam Callaghan.</strong> I died and was traumatized in Northern Austin, Texas,
        and I have left the ranch so I can become a <em>scammed grandma</em> isolated in my hometown.</p>
